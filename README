Lewis Class Scorer for calculating multiple classes of winners of an event.

This is based on the National Sporting Clays Association PDF on Lewis Class
Scoring, included with this distribution or available here: http://goo.gl/Ys0IK

There are two basic ways to use this code, as a script, or as a module.

Example usage as a stand-alone script:
- Create a file with scores, with your scoring criteria as space-separated
  items, from most to least important.  This example uses sporting clays
  scores, and shots before first miss to break ties.
  Note: You do not have to sort the input.

42 4 Tim Miller
47 21 Tim Brooks
35 6 Aaron Joyner

- Invoke this script and pass the path to that file as an argument:
./lewis_class.py ./path/to/scores
- It will print something like this:
Group 0
  47 21 Tim Brooks
  46 06 Bob Fleming
  46 04 Linc Huffman
Group 1
  37 02 Ken Callahan
  36 03 David Carswell
  36 00 Ivan Livas
Group 2
  25 00 Aaron Carswell
  24 01 Sasha Glenn
  24 01 Michael Callahan

Example usage as a module:
import lewis_class
scores = [[42, 2, 'Tim Miller'],
          [47, 21, 'Tim Brooks'],
          [35, 6, 'Aaron Joyner']]
classes = lewis_class.LewisClassScorer(scores)
